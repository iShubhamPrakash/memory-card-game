## How The Game Works

The game board consists of **sixteen "cards"** arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

The gameplay rules are very simple: Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

* You have 5 seconds to remember the positions of different cards.
* All the cards will be flipped back and you will find the pairs.

2. Player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
